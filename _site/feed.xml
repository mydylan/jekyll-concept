&lt;p&gt;We all know how the typical job interviewing process goes. We’ve all experienced it and know the drill. In most cases, after sharing some information about the company and shooting a series of commonplace questions about skills and personality, a recruiter will ask you if you have any questions to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the worst thing you can do at this point is to answer “Nope, sounds like you covered everything”. Firstly, if you have nothing to ask, this is an indicator that you are either not interested or not competent enough. Are you? Secondly, negative reply deprives you of brilliant chances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate the information you need. &lt;/strong&gt;The standard job interview usually does not give a comprehensive view of the company and the position you are applying for. The pre-written information is usually recited by rote and reveals only the light side of the company. However, at the bottom line, you are the one to take the final decision – to accept or reject a job offer, if it comes. So, to get the real picture and feel the vibe of the company, and make the decision quickly afterwards, dig deeper with the right questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more, recruiters may not be aware of what your priorities are, accentuating on motivation programs and perks in their stories, whereas your primary interest is in on-job education and mentoring. So, do ask. And if the recruiter doesn’t have answers to all your questions, appoint reverse interview with the right person – think one or two levels above the job you want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; The majority of HR professionals and senior management welcome curiosity from applicants. It shows initiative, motivation, interest and, well, guts. Handling reverse-interview approach will also demonstrate composure and determination – qualities highly valued for any position. This will present you in a positive light to the employer, and if others do not use reverse interviewing, you will set yourself apart from the competition and favourably stand out the crowd. That is the moment when you stop being “just another interviewee” and start being a legitimate job candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To show your expertise additionally.&lt;/strong&gt; Smart, thoughtful, on-topic questions will show your competence and keen insight into the industry and professional field. You also may go further and demonstrate all the spectrum of soft skills by embedding the right message in the questions. For example, want to show that you are a team player? Ask more about team members and teamwork. Strategic thinking is your strong suit – enquire about the strategic development of the company, product or department.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no matter the interview is labelled reverse or not, once the interview flow begins, you need to take responsibility for the process and drift into asking the questions. Do not think that it is a recruiter, the one holding all the cards in the hiring process. No, a job interview is a double-sided process, a two-way street, so use this and interview your employer even more than they interview you. Ideally, your questioning should seamlessly and smoothly integrate into interview conversation flow as dialogue is more illuminating form than an interrogation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it doesn’t mean you need to start blurting out reverse interview questions from the get-go. They should be well-thought-out and prepared, which means formulated in advance as a result of your research of the company and active involvement in the dialogue with an interviewer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies routinely update their websites and blogs and publish materials about their recent activities, successes, values and challenges on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. So you will not feel the lack of information while preparing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also can be a great idea to talk with the current and ex-employees of the company and to find out their opinion about the company. Of course, the answers will be somewhat individual, but I think you will manage to pick the wheat of facts from chaffs of subjectivism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb for successful reverse interview questions is formulating specific, open questions that show your sincere interest and keep the conversation going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, do not ask something that is either obvious or can be easily googled, like who are your major competitors; it will just show your incompetence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are great reverse interview questions then? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely, questions will vary, depending on the position and company, but I believe it would be useful for anybody to grill about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People. &lt;/strong&gt;The people you are going to work with and for are an essential aspect of the job. With them, you will meet at the coffee spot, solve day-to-day issues and seek support in tackling challenges. They can help you succeed or try to fail you. So, to find out as much as you can about their personalities, by asking something like “Who’s the most cautious in the team — the one who makes sure we stick to the plan?”. Alternatively, if possible, meet some people from the team to make sure you can connect. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture.&lt;/strong&gt; Culture aspect, although neglected at the reverse interviews often, is important, as only in great cultures work great people and build great products. Investigate what their attitude to mistakes, and if they take ownership and welcome accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processes.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t forget to check how agile the company is and how fast teams deliver? Do they take up innovation or slowly get immersed in trivia and bureaucracy? The processes should not be flowless, but well-established enough to enable the team to bring value and empower meake decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to understand what kind of impact you can make on the product you are going to work on. Will it be satisfying with both the technical challenges it brings, such as scale, as well as the emotional satisfaction of solving large and complex problems that affect many users. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-development&lt;/strong&gt;. Would they support you getting outside education or activities to broaden your skill set? Will the company send you to courses and conferences and thumb up when you participate in meetups, blogging, mentoring, and more?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun.&lt;/strong&gt; The fun aspect is not about parties and team-building activities. And the demanding environment is exciting to work in, but work should be a place which encourages you to get up in the morning, smile and go to make good things. It should be a place which fills you with satisfaction and respects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Titles, salary, and location are essential, don’t get me wrong,  you should enquire about them as well, but they are not the things that give meaning. And to grasp this, pose reverse interview questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now it’s your turn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I believe it is not worth discussing here the pros of a tech test task in the hiring process. As it is widely used worldwide by many companies from Valley corporation to garage startups. But, statistically, programmers (as well as other tech specialists) loathe test tasks. If you ask them why you would probably hear a few reasonings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usually, the time to complete a test task is underestimated. If a recruiter says it should take 3-4 hours, expect to spend 8+ hours. And this is way too long, rather boring and demotivating, especially if the technology stack is old.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies are trying to save their time (hence money) at the expense of candidates’. To shorten their interview process and spare hiring managers’ time, employers briefly phone interview a candidate and immediately give a test task, and then wonder why candidates are not motivated to do test task? Because they are not sure yet if the game is worth the candle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A test task as a way of developers’ screening is a questionable tool as it has a rather low ration of information received and time spent and may not always correctly filter the highly-skilled talent from the novice. Plus, very few skills and little knowledge can be revealed through test-taking, for example, problem-solving skills. Tests usually assess the coding ability and knowledge of algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies have an ill-established feedback process and either skip feedbacking or give untimely or give a poor one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some programmers claim that companies cheat candidates and give the test task to have some job done free of charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this poses a question – to test or not to test? It is a hard question. As on the one hand, there are applicants with their ‘truth’, and on the other, employers that are already sick and tired of batches of unqualified candidates with identically shiny resumes and need to spend oceans of time, examining the credibility of self-reported skills. Thus, their desire to shorten screening time and decrease cost-per-hire with the help of test tasks is natural. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if your company chooses to have an obligatory test task as a part of the recruiting process, at least make sure you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;give a short test task&lt;/strong&gt;, that is 2-3 hours utmost. Spending days of free work as a job application requirement is a burden for anyone. And since experienced developers are top requested these days, asking to complete a long test can result in them finding another job faster. Or you can set a time limit for the task completion. Let’s say 4-5 hours. This will also help you understand if the person can work productively under deadline. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and online. &lt;/strong&gt;Well, to travel to the company office to talk with a recruiter and then spend 3 hours for a test task is rather time-consuming and tiring, especially after the working day. Or one should take a day off the work, which is also not ideal for candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;offer lengthy deadlines&lt;/strong&gt;. Do not insist on a candidate submitting test results ‘today in the evening’. As on working days, especially if you’ve ignored item №1 of this list, and prepared a long test task, an applicant will either need to cheat on their present employer and do the task at working time (do not encourage dishonesty from others, as they may play the same trick with you later), or steal some time from family, or get in stress in case of some other upcoming commitments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;offer a test only after an HR interview.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not expect a candidate to be motivated to perform your test task if you didn’t conduct at least a short HR talk, didn’t discuss necessary conditions, salary and other perks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make it professional.&lt;/strong&gt; There are cases when the test task is created by not-exactly-the-right people. For example, small companies may lack some technology expertise or a senior person, who can prepare a relevant test task to hire a senior developer. So the test task can be composed by a middle specialist or a Scrum Master, or simply taken from the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;provide accurate instructions. &lt;/strong&gt;Decide what exactly you want to test and provide guidance accordingly. Don’t mix apples and oranges, as a two-hour algorithm implementation task will hardly help you assess problem-solving skills. As well as, 4-hour digging into API will require from you an explicit explanation of what outcome is expected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pay for it&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially if you cannot live without extended test tasks, I do not see other solutions, as to offer payment. Want to shorten costs? Do not give a test task to everyone, only for those, you feel are the right candidates. Yes, it may be a bad idea to pay for the test task if you plan to give it to every passerby, but if to the selected and the preinterviewed, yes, the sound idea! 60-100 USD for a company is not much, but can significantly shorten recruiters’ persuasion efforts and increase the pool of candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do not give it to everyone. &lt;/strong&gt;The hiring process is not one-size-fits-all. Do not test people who contribute to open-source, have high reputation level on Stack Overflow or own a GitHub repository that can showcase readable and maintainable code. Also, ask if they have pet-projects, they can share. My experience shows that passionate developers, however junior they may be, can demonstrate their coding skills through personal projects. It is not a secret that hi-tech talent are very in-demand these days, and they may find another job faster than doing your test.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;give it to juniors and…test task fans&lt;/strong&gt;. Is the test task a universal evil? No. The test task is great for juniors, as they have no experience and past projects to discuss at the job interview. As for the fans, yes, such unicorns exist and they are not that exotic as you may think. So, let the test tasks be done by the interested But if somebody is not or flatly refuses, don’t blame them for the lack of motivation and reject immediately, consider offering alternatives. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always provide feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; Like always. No matter the task is done well or not, especially if not, politely point out the candidate’s areas for growth. Invest time now, and you will not only contribute to company’s reputation, demonstrate the norm of mature behaviour, but also, if not for this project or company, then in the next, you may have a chance to work with the person side by side. I believe you understand that “Unfortunately we cannot move forward with you” is not the feedback. Do not worsen your karma and company image, have a well-establish your hiring process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;consider alternatives.&lt;/strong&gt; The test task is not a universal remedy either. There many other efficient ways to pre-screen and test people, like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;live coding&lt;/strong&gt; may appear to a truly valuable source of information. It allows to observe, in real time, a candidate’s logic, their ability to ask “the right” questions”, test communicative and collaborative skills in a dynamic within a team. Often live coding is done via screen sharing, but a company office will also do in case of a mutual agreement;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;probationary period&lt;/strong&gt;, as life shows, even brilliant test task results will not complete smooth performance afterwards. So the probationary period will set the record straight. Yes, it’s risky and can cost lots but building an A-plus team has always been venturous and challenging. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talantly.com/&quot;&gt;Talantly&lt;/a&gt; is intended to facilitate your hiring process and make your life a lot easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to cut a long story short, a test task is just an instrument, like a hammer which is used both for building and killing, and one should learn to use effectively to make it work for the good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Passive is not passive forever</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/recruiter%20notes/2019/09/30/passive-is-not-passive-forever/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Passive is not passive forever" /><published>2019-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/recruiter%20notes/2019/09/30/passive-is-not-passive-forever</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/recruiter%20notes/2019/09/30/passive-is-not-passive-forever/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.talantly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/angry-annoyed-coffee-52608-1140x694.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SEO_TEXT&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is tremendous worldwide competition for tech talent right now, and the shortfall of qualified candidates keeps escalating. Unemployment in the industry now is at its lowest rate in decades. Active recruitment mode, which has never been that efficient for hi-tech, now seems to have gone to the dogs. 99% of candidates for job posts are reported to be irrelevant, and the ‘right’ ones are like medieval knights who once existed but vanished, and recruiters can just tell legends about them, suspiring after good old days. All IT recruitment turned to be passive by definition, and unless you work for a highly recognizable brand, potential candidates generally see your outreach as a cold contact or spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To attract top tech talent in such a competitive marketplace is a kind of ‘mission-impossible’ task, and one of the ways is to increase the passive payoff by paving the way with a long-term relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive recruiting means courting potential candidates who are not currently looking for a job. Some companies and recruiters view it as a waste of time, but those who consider it as an investment can get high ROI. Because if they do not apply organically, that doesn’t mean they aren’t interested in moving. They may not be available immediately, but someday the knight may rise like a phoenix out of the ashes and ask if you have an opening for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how to architect a strategy to win over the passive candidates? What is the secret?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is like with the magic secret-ingredient soup of Panda Kung Fu’s father, where there is no secret ingredient. All candidates are different, and approaches should vary and be tailored for every particular case. But there is something every company and a recruiter can do… and should as it might serve a profound foundation for successful passive recruiting: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Provide a superior candidate experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A job change is traditionally known as a particularly not a pleasant experience, even for in-demand tech talent who seem to be able to call the shots. The biggest frustrations usually mentioned are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surface-level job descriptions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Templated outreach&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of response (‘radio silence’)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Floppy onboarding etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the key ingredient for hiring success is the best-in-class candidate experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candidates who are happy with the ongoing engagement are more likely to stay in touch for along (and if they end up elsewhere, provide future referrals and help spread a positive buzz with your company). Also, it goes without saying that content candidates are more apt to be content employees. Conversely, when a candidate’s experience with your company falls short of expectations or is even downright bad, you ruin any possibility of revisiting turned off candidates in the future as they simply wouldn’t like to hear from you. Plus, it can harm your brand in the outside world — whether that’s by word of mouth in their professional network or on recruiting or industry sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also one of the reasons, apart from universal humane, to hold juniors-tolerant attitude. One day they will become seniors, whom you would like to hunt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, start by eliminating ‘the biggest frustrations’, and this can already work wonders.  Also, adopt an empathetic approach, develop a partner relationship with candidates throughout the interview process and establish a healthy line of communication.  And it is not that difficult to do, as may seem, at least not more difficult than prowl the wides of the Internet in search for the right talent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the candidate-centric era of recruiting we live in, recruiters have to keep the right candidates constantly engaged and, without‌ ‌doubt, must rethink their roles and differentiate themselves by bringing a human touch back into the recruiting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Make easy and personal outreach &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the outreach phase alone, passive candidates are already overwhelmed. The most in-demand talent get six messages from recruiters a day. Also, the average InMail failure rate is 75%, let alone standard Linkedin messages, which are perceived as spam already. With such a low proportion of messages getting through, it is complicated to find a way to “sell” your opportunity to candidates to make them care, or pay attention at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some recruiters decide to follow the path of the least resistance and fill people’s inboxes with lots of templated messages. No wonder they come across as pushy or spammy as the quantity will never compensate lack of quality.  And this is terrible for the candidate, terrible for a recruiter, for the brand and terrible for hiring in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the quality of interaction matters as never before. Most messages candidates get are more pitch-oriented, and offer one-sided scenario. So, why not to make them more candidate-focused and personalized? Why not write honest and simple messages different from “I checked your Linkedin profile and think you’d be a great fit for the role…”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the conversation by referencing some personal details about candidates that other recruiters ignore (and I do not mean sending them Horoscopes for the day or discuss their Spirit Animals), it should be a blend of personal and professional and only staff publicly available.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where a little candidate research comes in handy. See what types of activities they’re engaged with; there might be others in your organization who have similar interests (bike riding to work, for example) that you can reference. Or look at trends that are affecting the role that you’re hiring for, or the types of content that the candidate might enjoy, even industry jokes that they might find funny (though be careful here!), whatever. Just go deep on their social footprint and give it a thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show people that you care and that you’ve taken the time to read up on them, and recruiting passive candidates becomes a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Build trusts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it is pretty obvious, but still … Trust is built only by being honest in passive recruiting. Do not give a rosy, ‘selling’ view of the company. Also, approach people only with useful information. It’s nice if you can write a friendly and interesting email. But, ultimately, passive candidates will consider changing jobs if they have a clear, trustworthy picture of what you can offer them. No matter it relates to a company’s culture and values as well as perks and benefits or salary. Candidates usually also want to know about the job expectations, workload, and how taking on a new role will impact their career. Salary transparency is also one of the top reasons for tech talent to start negotiating with a company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, don’t oversell. Find a compromise, the golden middle of what’s going to make both you, and the candidate happy. Such an approach will help build and nurture long-term candidate relationships, a cornerstone of recruitment. But be careful as they can also collapse as easy as a house of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try also connect as an industry expert rather than as a recruiter. In its essence, the recruiter’s job is to help professionals find an opportunity that is going to be the right fit for them. Even if it is not within your current company. Playing the role of a career coach or career advocate and steering the conversation towards the work that the candidate will do each day and how that aligns with their goals (or not) or recommending other job openings that might interest them will also build trust, loyalty and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Manage a pipeline effectively &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even front-line recruiters face serious challenges filling critical roles, and much of the problem stems from an inability to establish, nurture and grow a sustainable talent pipeline. As it is pretty hard to maintain involved communication with past candidates and stay up-to-date on all promising candidates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it is obvious that your pipeline should be automated. However, it is not enough. You can easily search for Java or SEO, but empirical skillsets and experience don’t always tell the whole story. The information stored in a database is usually a resume-like, explaining what the candidate has done in the past, and doesn’t give insight into what motivates the individual, what career aspirations each one has and the intent behind ‘considering the current opportunity’. The deeper you go in understanding what motivates each candidate, the faster and more predictably you’ll be able to move them through the candidate lifecycle to employment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So recruiters should take active steps, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talantly.com/&quot;&gt;established tools&lt;/a&gt; and best practices, change the mindset to build predictability and usability back into their candidate pipelines. The more personal details, thoughts and observations you’ll include into profiles, the better positioned you’ll be to engage in a transparent and successful negotiation with your passive candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, get in gear with an active pool of vetted candidates; drill down into more than just attributes to determine the right fit; engage candidates with a more meaningful recruiting experience, add transparency into your process, and you’ll become a better practitioner of shaping and aligning passive recruiting activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your company is only as good as its hiring process,” stated &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/author/chris-oneill/&quot;&gt;Chris O’Neill&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Evernote. And it is so true. It is not free lunches or in-office baristas that make companies great. Much more important is the impression they leave on people and experience people get while interacting with the company. So the hiring experience should be sound from the first moment, even if the candidate doesn’t end up as a company employee. And this relates to all steps of the interview process, phone screening including – though many perceive it as “just a talk”, it is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the official first round of the hiring process and an inevitable part in the majority of companies, and for good reason: They save a lot of time and effort. For the recruiter, it helps narrow potential candidate pool down to a manageable number, pre-select for the in-person interview with a hiring manager and ensure that the salary expectations are in range with the budget. For the candidate, it is a great chance to understand more about the company and the role, see if the values are compatible. Plus, it minimizes the expenses of everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it means a phone interview requires preparation, cannot be done on the spot and needs to be a qualitative one. Since there is a person’s facial expressions or other physical cues, which according to A. Mehrabian’s research accounts for 55% of information transmission, the preparation should be done especially carefully to be able to compensate for the missing body language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips that may come in handy for both recruiters and candidates, after the phone interview time slot has been reserved in your calendars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-a-phone-interview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before a phone interview &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do your homework.&lt;/em&gt; Study the resume thoroughly, make notes and write down questions. For me, a resume without remarks on it (or notes in the ATS) is not adequately processed. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look beyond the resume&lt;/em&gt;. Not all great tech-talent are brilliant resume-writers. Therefore, resumes are a particularly tricky tool, and not to overlook strong candidates and get biased from the beginning, google candidates. Meaning, look at a person and not just at a paper. This will help not to be silo-minded, see the bigger picture and compile thoughtful clarifying questions. The basic principles of recruiting are flexibility, responsiveness and emphasis on individuals — finding the right person to solve problems instead of simply the right ticks on a list of criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Get an in-depth insight into the vacancy. _Take the extra mile and find out as much as you can about the role you are interviewing for. Like it or not, but traditional job adverts tend to be rather a wishlist of skills which may not be available on the market or not entirely necessary for the project, so your task is to be well up in job details (project/product/customer, daily tasks, routine, future vision and plans etc.), as well as the reality of the day, and communicate it to the interviewees properly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practice describing your career.&lt;/em&gt; For sure, during the phone screen, you will go into more details about your work experience in different follow-up questions, so prepare, even act out this part if needed. Also, have projects or examples of your work prepared, preferably those that apply more directly with the potential job. Another step for being well prepared is to make kind of a brag list. And it is not about boasting of being overzealous. Actually, it is not that logical to tell what you did as it is stated in the resume. Nothing says “hire me” better than a track record of achieving remarkable results in past jobs, so don’t be shy! A great way to do this is by using the S-T-A-R method: Set up the situation and the tasks in context, describing what you did (the action) and what you achieved (the result).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Prepare questions. _Well, what you see in the job description is just the tip of the iceberg, and the amount of behind-the-scenes considerations is huge. So to be able to reach valid conclusions about the job and the company, generate the information you need with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.talantly.com/to-reverse-or-not-to-reverse/&quot;&gt;the right questions&lt;/a&gt;. It is most likely, you’ll be interested to learn if there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.talantly.com/the-pitfalls-of-the-test-task-for-tech-talent/&quot;&gt;a tech task&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.talantly.com/do-not-blame-work-from-home-but-start-at-home/&quot;&gt;remote work opportunity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t go in blind.&lt;/em&gt; Well, you’ve heard this tip a hundred times, I’m sure, so do not neglect it, as forewarned is forearmed! Research the company, it’s recent news, product/service offerings, and/or funding history (e.g. on &lt;a href=&quot;http://crunchbase.com/&quot;&gt;Crunchbase&lt;/a&gt;). And … research the person interviewing you. Yes, in the hi-tech world it is not a common practice, but in its essence recruiter’s job is to help people find a job they’ll love. In other words, a recruiter is supposed to be kind of a career consultant who always sides with a candidate and advocates their interests. So, do not lose the chance to get in good with a recruiter. But for that, you’ll need to learn more about the person. So, look up their LinkedIn profiles, Twitter /Facebook presence, and find their blogs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Ask what you need to bring/prepare. _Ask your contact what you should generally expect during the call, and if you’ll need to have any tools/material at the ready. This is an excellent time to figure out if you’ll be asked any technical questions or need to address specific specialized topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;during-the-interview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask only open questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“Did you work with technology X?” is not the right question, you know. Game _Is London the capital of Great Britain? _will not work here. As it gives you zero information, wastes time, and puts your interlocutor into an inferior position, let alone makes irritated. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Know your intents. _Every question should have a sense and a purpose – sounds pretty obvious, but so often overlooked. Interview questions are a window of opportunity if approached strategically. However, to build a particular strategy, you have to know what you want to learn about the candidate. If you are asking just for the sake of asking, it will lead to them answering for the sake of answering.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Listen actively. _After the first “right” answers, do not start daydreaming about making an offer to the candidate or getting your bonus. Listen to candidates attentively, ask follow-up questions, show genuine interest, as having your head in the clouds, you can miss important information. And most awkwardly, you may ask about something they’ve just told.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Do not talk a mile a minute. _People, yep, you’ve perfectly learned that company description text and can recite it, if awakened in the middle of the night. However, do speak like you are firing a burst, especially on the phone. Moreover, try to give a more comprehensive and deeper view of the company, then the candidates can find on the website. Do not make them bored listening to you from the first minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discuss salary.&lt;/em&gt; Many recruiters also find it hard to discuss and negotiate salaries properly. But leaving any mention of salary expectations to the end of the recruiting process is risky. Candidates look to recruiters for honesty and transparency around this vital aspect of a job, so be open to giving the real numbers your company/customer is ready to offer. Moreover, often, a lack of visibility into real hiring data contributes to a lengthy and unpredictable closing process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inform about the next steps.&lt;/em&gt; Providing an excellent experience means that candidates should never be left hanging to wonder about next steps. That’s also about creating a human process, constructed from a candidate’s perspective, which will results for you in recurring candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Take notes. _Even the most brilliant memory can fail, so to avoid calling again and bothering the candidate, better have some notes-taking tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not multitask.&lt;/em&gt; It might be tempting to check your to-do list or messenger (I have heard candidates washing dishes, eating lunch) while on a phone interview, but recruiters can easily tell if your attention is elsewhere. Needless to say, it is a great pet peeve, which doesn’t reflect well on your level of interest and, well, manners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Ask questions. _If you’ve done the preparation and have your list, do not lose the chance to sound them.&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.talantly.com/to-reverse-or-not-to-reverse/&quot;&gt; Reverse interview approach&lt;/a&gt; will bring you a lot of benefits. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know  your salary requirements.&lt;/em&gt; For me, it is strange when talking about salary expectations, people say, “I’m looking to make between $2,000 and $3,000.” Do you really think that you will be offered $3,000 when you stated you might agree for $2,000? So, not to feel disappointed or undervalued later, better voice the exact number not a range.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;_Take notes. _These will help you retain the information and ideas discussed, and will likely come in handy for your follow-up thank-you note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after-the-phone-interview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the phone interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Send feedback&lt;/em&gt; (within 2-3 days after the interview). Particular distress for both parties is the feedback process. Recruiters usually just fear to give it by voice, but good manners mean feedbacking the candidate by voice after the phone interview. If possible, state what was he/she good at and where to improve. If not possible to provide comprehensive feedback, then even a short, but honest and candidate focused reply will do. But ‘radio silence’ is the worst option. It means harm to your reputation, and company brand, no recurring candidates and the need to start over every time you have an opening. Groundhog Day, in short.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep in the loop.&lt;/em&gt; Yep, it is not quite your decision sometimes, and you need to consult with your hiring manager if to invite the candidate for the in-person interview, but it is your responsibility to regularly update the candidate if the decision is delayed for some reason. Remember, no news is still good news!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Send a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uppr.com.ua/articles/thank-you-for-the-interview.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘thank you’ email&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; _to the person who interviewed you right after the interview or before the end of that working day. It’s important to thank for their time, and an opportunity to reiterate why you’re excited about the position. There is called _The Interview Thank You Rule&lt;/em&gt; and it is a common practice. It states: every time you speak to someone new in the job interview process, you should thank them for their time. Well, and even if not a rule, it is netiquette, the act of politeness, maturity and professionalism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do a post-mortem.&lt;/em&gt; This is also a valuable time to reflect on what you think went well or didn’t go so well in your interview. Interviewing is a great way to get better at not only interviewing but it can also help you learn more about what you want and don’t want out of your next job, polish up communication and negotiation skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies spend stratospheric budgets on branding activities, recruitment PR-campaigns, fancy presentations about missions and values, Welcome Days, corporate parties videos distribution and other stuff bullshit to attract and retain top tech talent. But do not exploit the benefit that can play a critical role in accepting or rejecting a job offer nowadays – work from home option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, hi-tech companies do not differ much in their work conditions and available perks, so if a software engineer gets two equal or slightly different job offers, statistically priority will be given to the one that offers remote work opportunity. This is why at the job interviews, only the lazy don’t ask about the possibility to work from home, if not from the first day, then at least in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 remote work or work from home is not a hype or a trend anymore. This one of the available forms of teams and work process arrangement. Even must-have in the modern urban environment for the generation with a work-life balance as a top priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is crystal clear why for many people it is an indisputable motivating benefit – the bonuses it gives can not be compensated in any other way. Here are the most frequently named:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving money and efforts&lt;/strong&gt;. Commuting time with rush-hour traffic jams (some locations seem to have never-ending congestions) absurdly increased and gets people stressed and tired before they even get to work. Also, working from home one can expect to give away less money on food and clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The retained time can be spent on &lt;strong&gt;self-development and education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding the disrupting atmosphere of open-plan offices&lt;/strong&gt; with its continuously accelerating time waste and sustained anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible schedule&lt;/strong&gt; which enables people to have more qualitative rest and work on their own productivity peaks (though the room for manipulation is not that big here as may seem at the beginning, but still), which increases both efficiency and creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work-family balance&lt;/strong&gt;. It was proved that being able sometimes to make personal issues priority decreases stress levels and improve general well-being and happiness level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, work from home is not a “one-way street” case. There are also distinct benefits for companies, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable financial and resource savings. &lt;/strong&gt; Money usually outlay for rent, furniture, equipment and utilities can be invested in company development and retained space can be used for creating a comforting atmosphere in the office (arrange extra facilities like meeting rooms, rest zones, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster, easier and cheaper recruitment&lt;/strong&gt;. Companies offering work-from-home option face less competition and their chances to hire great talents double or even triple. So, they hire faster and cost per hire decreases. Moreover, they can enjoy passive recruitment more than anyone else. However, what is the most beneficial, they may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.talantly.com/&quot;&gt;start working with “best of the best”&lt;/a&gt; because with work from home option only the sky is the limit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differentiation &lt;/strong&gt;amongst those employers that don’t implement work-from-home practices, the company that does, can become kind of a unicorn, mystical, desired and well-recognised.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More mature and developed workers.&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it is not a secret that work from home is not for everyone: despite the physical possibility to stay at home and arrange a working place there, it requires a certain level of maturity and cast-iron self-discipline. And most issues companies have with remote workers can be eliminated with the help of the right hires – people ready to take responsibility for their action and continuously develop competencies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happier, more satisfied and loyal employees. &lt;/strong&gt;Such &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telecommuting-tech/telecommuting-found-to-boost-morale-cut-stress-idUSN1949776320071120&quot;&gt;a conclusion&lt;/a&gt; was reached by researchers of Pennsylvania State University, who surveyed and analysed 13 thousand remote workers. I do not see any grounds for mistrust, do you?.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productive employees = met deadlines.&lt;/strong&gt; No doubt that happy, satisfied, mature employees produce greater results!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the obvious advantages for both parties, working from home is still the job dream situation for millions of IT specialists. Only certain companies attained to the idea, and workers at limited job positions (primarily senior-level specialists) can enjoy the privilege of working from home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most frequent reasons/fears/myths mentioned are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underwork&lt;/strong&gt; (working less than 40 hours weekly). Frankly, do all office busy bees work 40 hours a week sharp? No. If to subtract coffee breaks, smoking, corridor small talks, being stuck in ineffective meetings, lost hours awaiting late colleagues, how much is left?  Over the course of an eight-hour workday, the average &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/8-hour-workday-may-be-5-hours-too-long-research-suggests-2017-9&quot;&gt;employee works for about three hours&lt;/a&gt; states Business Insider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in this respect, work from home is not that bad or ineffective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, well, you can always introduce remote Scrum meetings, daily calls, use Slack or any other chat to see what is going on during the day. Plus, task tracking systems will help ensure the job is done on time. Anyway, you buy their talent, not their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication mishaps.&lt;/strong&gt; Communication is probably one of the key reasons for all the problems in any company. Distance may intensify them, but not that much. With modern world opportunities, communication means and channels, this gap can be reduced to a minimum. Moreover, the unresponsiveness of teammates is always a more personal issue. Hence, well- establish processes, and overall communication will go swimmingly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roadblocks in management&lt;/strong&gt;. Some employers believe that if the employee does not have a manager behind the back, monitoring them round the clock, then they bungle a job and miss deadlines. However, when in the office, do the managers continuously look at the workers’ computer screens and ask what they are doing every half an hour? If yes, then it is not a manager and hyper controlling micro-managing moron with an inferiority complex. Autonomous, well organised, professional adults do not need constant supervision. So, here, stakeholders should decide whether they want to excel and provide corresponding freedom and trust?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff turnover. &lt;/strong&gt;Come on. Retention of tech talent is a troublesome issue worldwide. And not because specialists can go to job interviews uncontrollably during work hours, but because something is missing or not done correctly by a current employer. So, do not blame work from home, but start at home!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely, there much more objections against implementing work from home practices, but mainly they are lame excuses to cover companies’ reluctance to learn and change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there is always room for negotiation, alternatives and agreements. For example, companies may start offering a mixed schedule (1-2-3 days from home) or offer work from home option only for high performers, suggest some kind of work-from-home probation period or test people for the need skills, whatever. In my opinion, options here are limitless here and worth trying, and bonuses – competing for. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
